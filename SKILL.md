# Radical Freedom Assessment

Analyze what genuine freedom exists within a constrained situation by distinguishing facticity (the unchangeable givens) from transcendence (the capacity to choose meaning and response). Neither deny real limits nor accept false determinism.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens. Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "Do I have a choice here?"
- User claims to be completely determined by circumstances
- User wants to understand what freedom they actually have
- Analysis of a situation that feels constraining
- Someone needs to distinguish real limits from self-imposed ones
- Before making a difficult decision within constraints

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **situation** | Yes | Description of the constrained situation |
| **perceived_constraints** | Yes | What the person believes limits their freedom |
| **desired_action** | No | What they would do if "free" |

## Sartre's Framework

### The Human Condition
We are neither pure freedom (angels) nor pure thing (rocks). We are embodied, historical, situated beings who are nonetheless radically free within our situation.

### Facticity (Facticite)
The given facts of our existence that we cannot change:
- Our body and its capacities
- Our past choices and their consequences
- The historical moment we exist in
- Our material circumstances
- The laws of physics
- Death

**Key insight:** Facticity is real. We cannot wish it away. Sartre is not a naive voluntarist.

### Transcendence
Our capacity to go beyond our facticity through:
- Choosing the meaning of our situation
- Projecting ourselves into the future
- Taking a stance toward our past
- Responding rather than merely reacting
- Creating values through commitment

**Key insight:** We always transcend our situation in some way. Even in chains, we choose our response to the chains.

### Situation
The intersection of facticity and transcendence where choice actually occurs. We are always "in situation"—neither pure freedom nor pure determinism.

## Workflow
### Step 1: Map the Facticity
List the genuine givens that cannot be changed by mere will:
- Material constraints (money, physical capacity, time)
- Consequences of past choices already made
- Other people's independent choices
- Physical laws and biological realities
- Historical and social context

**Test:** Could this change through my choice alone, or is it genuinely external?

### Step 2: Map the Transcendence
List the domains of freedom that remain:
- Meaning you assign to the situation
- Your response and attitude
- Future choices still available
- Values you affirm through action
- How you relate to the constraints

**Test:** Even if I can't change X, can I choose my response to X?

### Step 3: Expose False Facticity
Identify constraints that appear as givens but are actually choices:
- "I have to" (usually means "I choose to because...")
- "There's no way" (usually means "I'm not willing to...")
- "The situation demands" (situations don't demand; we interpret)

### Step 4: Identify Authentic Freedom
What actual choices exist within this situation?
- Choices about meaning and interpretation
- Choices about response and engagement
- Choices about future direction
- Choices about what to value

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- Situation: "I'm diagnosed with a serious illness"
- Perceived constraints: "Everything is out of my control now"
- Desired action: "I want to live my life fully but feel helpless"

**Output:**

## Radical Freedom Assessment

### Facticity (Genuine Givens)
- The diagnosis itself: a medical fact
- The body's biological processes
- The statistical prognosis
- Past choices that may have contributed (unchangeable now)
- The healthcare system's capacities and limits
- Mortality (true for all humans, now more visible)

### Transcendence (Domains of Freedom)
- The meaning you assign to this illness
- How you spend the time you have
- What relationships you prioritize
- Whether you engage in treatment and how
- Your attitude toward uncertainty
- What you create, express, or leave behind
- How you face mortality—with denial, despair, or affirmation

### False Facticity Exposed
"Everything is out of my control" is not true. You cannot control the illness, but you have not lost all freedom. The illness has changed your situation; it has not determined your response to that situation.

You are not "helpless." You are a free consciousness in a new, harder situation. Helplessness would mean no choice at all—but you still choose, every day, how to live with this.

### Your Actual Freedom
You are free to:
- Choose treatment or not, and how you engage with it
- Choose what this illness means for your life
- Choose how to spend your remaining time (however long)
- Choose to despair or to affirm life even now
- Choose to deepen relationships or withdraw
- Choose what matters to you now

"Freedom is what we do with what is done to us."

### Sartre's Insight
Even in the face of illness and death—perhaps especially then—you remain free. The situation has changed radically; your freedom to respond has not. The person who faces death with lucidity and engagement is no less free than the person in perfect health who flees from life into distraction.

You cannot choose whether you are ill. You can choose what kind of person you are while ill.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| User wants to deny facticity | Gently but firmly acknowledge real limits |
| Severe material constraint | Focus on freedom of response and meaning |
| User feels patronized | Stay phenomenological; describe, don't lecture |
| Genuine total constraint (e.g., imprisonment) | Even there, some transcendence remains—attitude, inner life |
